So if you were to set width = 100px without this setting, then your width would actually be 100px + padding + border. When most people set width = 100px, they want width = 100px. Why it doesn't default to this setting I have no idea.\n\n```\nhtml {\n  font-size: 62.5%;\n}\n\nbody {\n  font-size: 1.6rem;\n}\n```\n\n`rem` units enable one to size things relative to the `font-size` of `html`. `rem` units are generally preferrable to `px` or `em` because they scale relative to the global font-size (without the confusion of `em` depending on its parent).\n\n`1 rem = 10 * font-size of html`\n\nMaking the html `font-size` 10px means that `1rem = 10px`, making calculations easier. But it's not good practice to directly set the html font-size because that overrides the user's default browser font-size settings, so we set the font-size to a percentage. The default font-size is generally 16px, and 62.5% of 16px = 10px.\n\nA font-size of 1.6rem sets the body font-size back to 100%, or 16px on most browsers (16px _ 62.5% _ 1.6 = 16px)\n\n```\nh1,h2,h3,h4,h5,h6 {\n  margin-top: 0;\n}\n```\n\nTo be honest you should probably get rid of all the margins, but at the very least you should remove the top margin because it's totally unnecessary.\n\n```\na {\n  color: <anything else>\n  text-decoration: none;\n}\n```\n\nThe default link color is atrocious. Remove the underline, and change the color to anything else.\n\n```\n@media (prefers-color-scheme: dark) {\n  body {\n    background-color: hsl(0, 0%, 15%);\n    color: white;\n  }\n}\n```\n\nActually [I prefer to put dark mode in classes (and CSS variables) in order to allow the user to toggle between dark/light mode](/dark-mode), but if you're just spinning something up quickly then this is the least you can do. And either way you should be reading the media query, even if via Javascript (see [article](/dark-mode) for more).\n\nThere's a lot more CSS I include, this is just a barebones starting point.","html":"<p>Here's some of the HTML/CSS code I include in every project.</p>\n<h3 id=\"html\">HTML</h3>\n<pre><code>&lt;meta charset='utf-8' /&gt;\n&lt;meta http-equiv='x-ua-compatible' content='ie=edge' /&gt;\n&lt;meta name='viewport' content='width=device-width,initial-scale=1,shrink-to-fit=no' /&gt;\n</code></pre>\n<p>This HTML code will make your site look normal on mobile, specifically the last line.</p>\n<h3 id=\"css\">CSS</h3>\n<pre><code>*, ::after, ::before {\n  box-sizing: border-box;\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>Without this, <code>width</code> and <code>height</code> don't include padding and border width.
