This was a lot of fun. Also made a lot of 2d visualizations with D3.js.</p>\n<p>After that I noticed that the front end could be heavily simplified with a front-end framework. So I researched them (the big 3 at the time were Angular 1, React, and Ember.js), and we ended up adopting Angular, which turned out to be a great decision (though I’ve since switched to React).</p>\n<p>This is easily the most varied engineering role I’ve ever had. I don’t know of any jobs where an engineer is working on distributed data processing one month, and then 3d data visualizations the next. I had no experience with any of this stuff prior to being assigned to work on them, so I had to learn how to teach myself. Some of the stuff I was working on was so cutting edge that there were very few online resources.</p>\n<p>I’m grateful for this role as it exposed me to types of work I never would’ve encountered otherwise.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Varick Media - Data Engineering to 3D Visualizations","date":"September 01, 2014","cover":{"publicURL":"/static/varick-caedd278b2dfb1eda3a7e34b6f35a745.png","childImageSharp":{"sizes":{"base64":"data:image/png;base64,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","aspectRatio":1.7779456193353473,"src":"/static/caedd278b2dfb1eda3a7e34b6f35a745/dc9f7/varick.png","srcSet":"/static/caedd278b2dfb1eda3a7e34b6f35a745/3fa08/varick.png 500w,\n/static/caedd278b2dfb1eda3a7e34b6f35a745/e9c7b/varick.png 1000w,\n/static/caedd278b2dfb1eda3a7e34b6f35a745/dc9f7/varick.png 2000w,\n/static/caedd278b2dfb1eda3a7e34b6f35a745/40725/varick.png 3000w,\n/static/caedd278b2dfb1eda3a7e34b6f35a745/2e174/varick.png 3531w","sizes":"(max-width: 2000px) 100vw, 2000px"}}}}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/varick/"}}}
