I rebuilt the website from the ground up as a universal Javascript Single-Page Application using Node.js, React, and Redux. Ultimately I hired, managed, and mentored a team of 5 engineers to work on the codebase, and was promoted to “Engineering Lead”.</p>\n<h4>Company Overview</h4>\n<p>Vroom makes over $1b/yr in revenue buying and selling used cars online. Their goal is to make buying a used car as easy as buying a pair of shoes online. Vroom.com is the company’s flagship ecommerce website.</p>\n<h4>The Problem - Old Website</h4>\n<p>Unfortunately their website had a lot of issues, which is why I was hired to rewrite it. Here were some of the problems:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Extremely slow. Pages would take anywhere from 500ms-5s to load. In the ecommerce world, this directly translates to lost revenue.</li>\n<li>Website had a lot of bugs</li>\n<li>Development time was very slow. Deployment was infrequent. The simplest of tasks would take weeks. The stakeholders were fed up. </li>\n<li>Expensive</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Server costs were relatively high.</p>\n<h3>My Proposal - New Website</h3>\n<p>I decided to build a Universal Javascript Single-Page App with Node.js, React, and Redux.</p>\n<p>server-side rendering</p>\n<p>store cars in memory</p>\n<p>The existing website was powered by .NET and Azure on the backend, and had a bit of React on the frontend, but without any framework.</p>\n<p>To do this we had two options, build our own </p>\n<p>Next.js?</p>\n<p>SSR SPA def a pain in the @$$</p>\n<p>CSS</p>\n<p>A/B testing</p>\n<p>caching cars</p>\n<p>SEO</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Site Performance</li>\n<li>Development Time</li>\n<li>Reduced server costs</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I remember the CEO approaching me to congratulate me on the website, saying it was blazing fast.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>URL as source of truth</li>\n<li>splitting by domain (modules)</li>\n<li>code splitting - vendor + page</li>\n</ul>\n<p>memoize</p>\n<p>Code reviews</p>\n<h3>Management</h3>\n<p>We adopted agile/scrum for the sake of scoping out the work and giving a sense of structure. I did weekly 1-on-1 meetings with each member of my team to ensure no one was blocked and any concerns would be voiced.</p>\n<p>I’m a strong believer in empowering individuals, and am very much against micromanagement as I believe it is patronizing, unproductive, and reduces morale. If a team member isn’t pulling his or her weight, he/she is generally aware. We’ll have a talk to understand what’s going on and to see if things can be improved. If things don’t turn around after that, well then that doesn’t leave many other options…</p>\n<p>In any case, I prefer being direct and understanding. One should never be passive aggressive - it just makes everyone miserable (in general, not just at work).</p>\n<h3>Feedback</h3>\n<p>The </p>\n<p>Promotion to Lead Engineer.</p>\n<h3>Conclusion</h3>\n<p>I’m so grateful to have been given this opportunity. Specifically, I have to thank John Rodkey for believing in me. And of course I have to thank the team who brought this to life, and continue to carry it on after I’ve left.</p>\n<p>The new site is blazing fast and light years ahead of the old one. Developing on the site is so easy, it’s “boring” (in a good way :P). To be honest, I’d never seen an ecommerce site as a single-page app, but I’m convinced the entire web will eventually move to single-page apps as the technology gets easier to develop. You just can’t beat the page speed performance of not having page refreshes.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Vroom - Building an Ecommerce Website From Scratch","date":"July 12, 2017","cover":{"publicURL":"/static/vroom_catalog-d4176851e95ab504492980b26333e3e7.png","childImageSharp":{"sizes":{"base64":"data:image/png;base64,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","aspectRatio":2.0226554267650156,"src":"/static/d4176851e95ab504492980b26333e3e7/dc9f7/vroom_catalog.png","srcSet":"/static/d4176851e95ab504492980b26333e3e7/3fa08/vroom_catalog.png 500w,\n/static/d4176851e95ab504492980b26333e3e7/e9c7b/vroom_catalog.png 1000w,\n/static/d4176851e95ab504492980b26333e3e7/dc9f7/vroom_catalog.png 2000w,\n/static/d4176851e95ab504492980b26333e3e7/40725/vroom_catalog.png 3000w,\n/static/d4176851e95ab504492980b26333e3e7/c0943/vroom_catalog.png 3839w","sizes":"(max-width: 2000px) 100vw, 2000px"}}}}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/vroom/"}}}
